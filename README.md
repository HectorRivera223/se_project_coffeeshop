# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## This project was very fun to write, very challenging, and a few problems. But nonetheless, I overcame it ,and am very proud of it. This is my first project that has animations, fieldsets, and all working mechanics.

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

I plan on trying harder, this project actually made me love coding a lot. For the fact, i am getting it more even though its just the second sprint. I will give it my all, I will work on getting on more ,and getting more into it. I need to study a little more. Because, even though I did some on my own,I stil needed help to get through the project. But the more I do it, the better I'll get.

Add your ideas here :)
